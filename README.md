#  Election Data Cleaning & Analysis

This project demonstrates how real-world **election poll data** can be cleaned, processed, and analyzed using Python. It showcases the use of data preprocessing techniques, handling inconsistencies, treating missing values, and performing insightful visualizations on voter trends and results.

 Project Objective

To clean, structure, and analyze Indian election poll data to:

- Identify trends in voting patterns
- Standardize inconsistent data fields (e.g., party abbreviations, missing genders, etc.)
- Prepare datasets for further modeling or public reporting
- Gain actionable insights from unstructured raw data

---

 Dataset Description

The raw data consists of Indian election results including:

- Constituency Names
- Candidate Details
- Party Affiliation (often inconsistent)
- Vote Counts
- Gender and other demographics

The dataset initially had:
- Missing values
- Duplicate party names (like "BJP", "B.J.P.", "Bharatiya Janata Party")
- Formatting inconsistencies
- Nulls in gender and vote columns

 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3
- Pandas ‚Äì Data manipulation & cleaning
- NumPy ‚Äì Numeric operations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn‚Äì Visualizations
- Jupyter Notebook‚Äì Development environment

 Data Cleaning Process

- Removed irrelevant or null-heavy columns
- Filled missing values using conditional logic
- Standardized party names using frequency mapping
- Converted data types (like vote count to integers)
- Cleaned inconsistent text fields


 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizations and aggregations were used to answer questions like:

- Which party had the most candidates?
- What was the average vote share?
- Gender-wise candidate participation?
- State-wise performance metrics?

Graphs Used:
- Bar charts (party-wise candidate count)
- Pie charts (gender representation)
- Histograms (vote distributions)


 Insights Gained

- Majority of top candidates came from a few major parties
- Gender representation was skewed heavily toward male candidates
- Some parties had high participation but low average votes
- Cleaning party names drastically improved clarity of EDA
